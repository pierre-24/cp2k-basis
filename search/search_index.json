Why CP2K? \u00a4 CP2K is a quantum chemistry program that can perform atomistic simulations. It is especially known for mixing Gaussian and plane wave approaches, which are useful to perform ab initio molecular dynamics, among others . Why this if there is the basis set exchange? \u00a4 The basis set exchange (BSE), developed by MolSSI is a trustworthy provider of basis sets and effective core potentials (ECP) since a long time ago. It even provides an output for CP2K. In fact, this project has no intention of replacing the BSE, and users should happily continue to use it to fetch ECP and all-electron basis sets (don't forget to use the ALL potential if needed, thought). However, CP2K calculations can also use a pair of matching GTH potentials and corresponding basis sets . This is actually one of the first thing you learn when you try to use the CP2K program . They are not available in the BSE, so this is where this project is useful, by allowing the users to look through the library of available basis sets and pseudopotentials with a web interface similar to the BSE . Behind the scene, it also provides a library to read, write and store CP2K basis sets and potentials. Alternatives? \u00a4 The official cp2k-data repository , which might contain more up to date version of GTH potentials. This webpage , which provide an easy way to explore the previous repository. Other tools (related to input and output) are also listed in the CP2K documentation .

Building the library (with cb_fetch_data ) \u00a4 Creating a library from the YAML source file \u00a4 Info The current library and the source YAML file are available here . From an existing YAML source file DATA_SOURCE.yml with the format described below, just use cb_fetch_data DATA_SOURCES.yml -o library.h5 This will create a library.h5 file , which might be exploited latter on . If you want to have insight on what is happening, you might want to use: LOGLEVEL = INFO cb_fetch_data DATA_SOURCES.yml -o library.h5 which is more verbose. Description of the YAML source file format \u00a4 Repositories \u00a4 Building the library requires a YAML file which describe all the sources for the basis sets and pseudopotentials . It is composed of: repositories : # list of repositories metadata : # metadata for each basis set and pseud The first item is a list of repositories. A repository is defined by a base url ( base ), which is a template. Keyword inside curly braces will be replaced by their value given in the keyword dictionary (following the Python format() syntax ). Example With: repositories : - base : https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/raw/{commit}/data/ data : commit : '786bc82ff9ded3e1f761cba6d8e25c3c9fe19bb1' the base URL will be https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/raw/786bc82ff9ded3e1f761cba6d8e25c3c9fe19bb1/data/ . Then, ach repository has different files (listed files ). Files \u00a4 Each file is described using the following structure: name : <NAME> type : BASIS_SETS family_name : # dictionary (mandatory) variant : # dictionary (mandatory) Each file has a name and a type linked to its content, which is either BASIS_SETS or POTENTIALS . While gathering the file, cb_fetch_data will download it from <BASE_URL>/<NAME> . Example From the following structure: repositories : - base : https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/raw/{commit}/data/ data : commit : '786bc82ff9ded3e1f761cba6d8e25c3c9fe19bb1' files : - name : BASIS_MOLOPT type : BASIS_SETS The URL https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/raw/786bc82ff9ded3e1f761cba6d8e25c3c9fe19bb1/data/BASIS_MOLOPT will be used to fetch the file. Note It is possible to apply a patch (in the unified diff format ) by adding a patch option, whose value should be a path (relative to the directory where the YAML file is) to a patch file. This is useful to correct small inconsistencies or mistake. Sorting out the content of the file \u00a4 As you can see if you check out a file in the CP2K data/ folder , each file contains different basis sets (or pseudopotential) for different atom, so one should help cb_fetch_data to sort out everything. There are definition for each atom, followed by nicknames which indicates which basis set/pseudopotential this is. There may be multiple nickname, though there is usually two, of the form <name> <name>-qX , where <name> is the family name and the -qX variant indicate the number of valence electrons . Example In, e.g., BASIS_MOLOPT , one has: H SZV-MOLOPT-GTH SZV-MOLOPT-GTH-q1 # ... H DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH-q1 # ... H TZVP-MOLOPT-GTH TZVP-MOLOPT-GTH-q1 # ... C SZV-MOLOPT-GTH SZV-MOLOPT-GTH-q4 # ... From the nicknames cb_fetch_data should figure out in which family (i.e., the basis set or pseudopotential) it will store this definition. Since the naming is not systematic (not always of the form <name>-qX ), one has to resort to a heavier tool which can show some flexibility. Thus, this is performed thanks to the family_name dictionary, which contains a REGEX as the key and a replacement as the value. All the nickname are checked against the REGEX, in the order given in the file. If a REGEX matches, then the search stops and: If the replacement is ~ (the null value in YAML), the name is discarted Otherwise, the replacement is yield, using pattern.replace(name, replacement) If at the end, no REGEX matches, the name is just discarded. Example With: repositories : - base : https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/raw/{commit}/data/ data : commit : '786bc82ff9ded3e1f761cba6d8e25c3c9fe19bb1' files : - name : BASIS_MOLOPT type : BASIS_SETS family_name : '^(.*)(-q\\d{1,2})$' : '\\1' cb_fetch_data will apply the REGEX to every nickname, and will end up with a list of family names. With SZV-MOLOPT-GTH SZV-MOLOPT-GTH-q1 , the result will be in both cases SZV-MOLOPT-GTH . Then, the variant dictionary is used to determine the variant (i.e., the number of valence electron, in the form qXX ) from the nicknames. The rules are the same as with family_name , but only the first result will be used. Example With: repositories : - base : https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/raw/{commit}/data/ data : commit : '786bc82ff9ded3e1f761cba6d8e25c3c9fe19bb1' files : - name : BASIS_MOLOPT type : BASIS_SETS family_name : '^(.*)(-q\\d{1,2})$' : '\\1' variant : '^.*-(q\\d{1,2})$' : '\\1' cb_fetch_data will apply the REGEX to every nickname, and will take the first result. With SZV-MOLOPT-GTH SZV-MOLOPT-GTH-q1 , the first nickname yield no result, while the second yield q1 , which will be used. Adding metadata \u00a4 Finaly, cb_fetch_data , it will add metadata to those families. To do so, the metdata dictionary will be used, in which the key is a REGEX matched against the name of the family. The if there is a match, then all the values are attributed as metadata. Example With: repositories : - base : https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/raw/{commit}/data/ data : commit : '786bc82ff9ded3e1f761cba6d8e25c3c9fe19bb1' files : - name : BASIS_MOLOPT type : BASIS_SETS family_name : '^(.*)(-q\\d{1,2})$' : '\\1' variant : '^.*-(q\\d{1,2})$' : '\\1' metadata : '^SZV-MOLOPT-GTH$' : references : [ https : //github.com/cp2k/cp2k-data ] description : A double zeta basis set '.*' : references : [ https : //github.com/cp2k/cp2k-data ] description : MOLOPT basis set. For the basis set SZV-MOLOPT-GTH , the metadata will contain two fields: references and description (which will contain \"A double zeta basis set\") For the basis set DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH (or any other basis, thanks to the use of .* ), the fields in the metadata will be the same, but the value of description is different (\"MOLOPT basis set.\"). For the moment, references , description and tags are the three metadata that should be reported for every basis set and pseudopotential. Note In practice, the YAML format defines anchors and aliases , which allow to define references and tags once and use them multiple time. Using the library \u00a4 Info If you want to know how the basis sets and pseudopotentials are actually stored in the library file, check out this page . Currently, the web interface is the easiest way to query the library. However, you can have a quick overview of the content of the library using: cb_explore_library library.h5 You can also use the cp2k_basis library developed for this project. Example See there for some of Python code to access the library and query its content. Improving the library \u00a4 To improve the library, it might be easier to work directly with the file in question. This is possible with the cb_explore_file command. It takes a source YAML containing a list of files as an input, so that you can experiment before actually updating the library. An example: adding BASIS_MOLOPT_UCL \u00a4 Issue #6 requested the addtion of BASIS_MOLOPT_UCL to the library. This will be used as an example. First of all, download the file (notice the /raw/ ): wget https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/raw/master/data/BASIS_MOLOPT_UCL Then create a source.yml file: touch source.yml This file will follow the same syntax as the one described above for files , so the following skeleton can be used files : - name : BASIS_MOLOPT_UCL type : BASIS_SETS family_name : variant : metadata : You can now run cb_explore_file ... But nothing much happens: $ cb_explore_file source.yml * | +- basis_sets | * | +- pseudopotentials | Indeed, after it has read source.yml , the program reports the content it has extracted, which is in that case nothing. This is normal: as described above , if no rule matches the nickname, they are just discarded. This is the case here, since there is no rule. Hopefully, the solution in this case is pretty straightforward: the name can be easily extracted from nicknames such as TZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH-q3 , and so is the variant. Example With the following source.yml , files : - name : BASIS_MOLOPT_UCL type : BASIS_SETS family_name : '^(.*)(-q\\d{1,2})$' : '\\1' variant : '^.*-(q\\d{1,2})$' : '\\1' metadata : The result is better: $ cb_explore_file source.yml * | +- basis_sets | +- TZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH | metadata={'source': 'BASIS_MOLOPT_UCL'} | | | +- Li: q3 | +- Be: q4 (...) The following basis sets were extracted: $ cb_explore_file source.yml | grep \" +-\" +- TZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH +- TZV2P-MOLOPT-SR-GTH +- DZVPd-MOLOPT-SR-GTH +- TZVPd-MOLOPT-SR-GTH +- TZV2Pd-MOLOPT-SR-GTH +- SZV-MOLOPT-SR-GTH +- DZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH +- SZV-MOLOPT-GTH +- DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH +- TZVP-MOLOPT-GTH +- TZV2P-MOLOPT-GTH +- TZV2PX-MOLOPT-GTH +- DZV-MOLOPT-SR-GTH Now you just need to add the metadata and iterate on the result until you are happy. Example With the following source.yml , files : - name : BASIS_MOLOPT_UCL type : BASIS_SETS family_name : '^(.*)(-q\\d{1,2})$' : '\\1' variant : '^.*-(q\\d{1,2})$' : '\\1' metadata : '^TZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH$' : references : [ https : //github.com/cp2k/cp2k-data ] description : Short-range triple zeta (+ polarization) basis set. tags : [ MOLOPT , SR , GTH ] Metadata were added to the basis sets: $ cb_explore_file source.yml * | +- basis_sets | +- TZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH | metadata={'references': ['https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k-data'], 'description': 'Short-range triple zeta (+ polarization) basis set.', 'tags': ['MOLOPT', 'SR', 'GTH']} | | | +- Li: q3 | +- Be: q4 (...) When you are happy with the result (metadata should be defined for all basis sets!), you can add it to the main DATA_SOURCES.yml and do a pull request.","title":"Build, use and improve the library"},{"location":"developers/library_build/#building-using-and-improving-the-library","text":"This page describes how to manipulate the library of basis sets and pseudopotentials.","title":"Building, using and improving the library"},{"location":"developers/library_build/#building-the-library-with-cb_fetch_data","text":"","title":"Building the library (with cb_fetch_data)"},{"location":"developers/library_build/#creating-a-library-from-the-yaml-source-file","text":"Info The current library and the source YAML file are available here .

Example With: repositories : - base : https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/raw/{commit}/data/ data : commit : '786bc82ff9ded3e1f761cba6d8e25c3c9fe19bb1' files : - name : BASIS_MOLOPT type : BASIS_SETS family_name : '^(.*)(-q\\d{1,2})$' : '\\1' variant : '^.*-(q\\d{1,2})$' : '\\1' metadata : '^SZV-MOLOPT-GTH$' : references : [ https : //github.com/cp2k/cp2k-data ] description : A double zeta basis set '.*' : references : [ https : //github.com/cp2k/cp2k-data ] description : MOLOPT basis set. For the basis set SZV-MOLOPT-GTH , the metadata will contain two fields: references and description (which will contain \"A double zeta basis set\") For the basis set DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH (or any other basis, thanks to the use of .* ), the fields in the metadata will be the same, but the value of description is different (\"MOLOPT basis set.\"). For the moment, references , description and tags are the three metadata that should be reported for every basis set and pseudopotential. Note In practice, the YAML format defines anchors and aliases , which allow to define references and tags once and use them multiple time.","title":"Adding metadata"},{"location":"developers/library_build/#using-the-library","text":"Info If you want to know how the basis sets and pseudopotentials are actually stored in the library file, check out this page . Currently, the web interface is the easiest way to query the library. However, you can have a quick overview of the content of the library using: cb_explore_library library.h5 You can also use the cp2k_basis library developed for this project. Example See there for some of Python code to access the library and query its content.","title":"Using the library"},{"location":"developers/library_build/#improving-the-library","text":"To improve the library, it might be easier to work directly with the file in question.

This will be used as an example. First of all, download the file (notice the /raw/ ): wget https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/raw/master/data/BASIS_MOLOPT_UCL Then create a source.yml file: touch source.yml This file will follow the same syntax as the one described above for files , so the following skeleton can be used files : - name : BASIS_MOLOPT_UCL type : BASIS_SETS family_name : variant : metadata : You can now run cb_explore_file ... But nothing much happens: $ cb_explore_file source.yml * | +- basis_sets | * | +- pseudopotentials | Indeed, after it has read source.yml , the program reports the content it has extracted, which is in that case nothing. This is normal: as described above , if no rule matches the nickname, they are just discarded. This is the case here, since there is no rule. Hopefully, the solution in this case is pretty straightforward: the name can be easily extracted from nicknames such as TZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH-q3 , and so is the variant. Example With the following source.yml , files : - name : BASIS_MOLOPT_UCL type : BASIS_SETS family_name : '^(.*)(-q\\d{1,2})$' : '\\1' variant : '^.*-(q\\d{1,2})$' : '\\1' metadata : The result is better: $ cb_explore_file source.yml * | +- basis_sets | +- TZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH | metadata={'source': 'BASIS_MOLOPT_UCL'} | | | +- Li: q3 | +- Be: q4 (...) The following basis sets were extracted: $ cb_explore_file source.yml | grep \" +-\" +- TZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH +- TZV2P-MOLOPT-SR-GTH +- DZVPd-MOLOPT-SR-GTH +- TZVPd-MOLOPT-SR-GTH +- TZV2Pd-MOLOPT-SR-GTH +- SZV-MOLOPT-SR-GTH +- DZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH +- SZV-MOLOPT-GTH +- DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH +- TZVP-MOLOPT-GTH +- TZV2P-MOLOPT-GTH +- TZV2PX-MOLOPT-GTH +- DZV-MOLOPT-SR-GTH Now you just need to add the metadata and iterate on the result until you are happy. Example With the following source.yml , files : - name : BASIS_MOLOPT_UCL type : BASIS_SETS family_name : '^(.*)(-q\\d{1,2})$' : '\\1' variant : '^.*-(q\\d{1,2})$' : '\\1' metadata : '^TZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH$' : references : [ https : //github.com/cp2k/cp2k-data ] description : Short-range triple zeta (+ polarization) basis set. tags : [ MOLOPT , SR , GTH ] Metadata were added to the basis sets: $ cb_explore_file source.yml * | +- basis_sets | +- TZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH | metadata={'references': ['https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k-data'], 'description': 'Short-range triple zeta (+ polarization) basis set.', 'tags': ['MOLOPT', 'SR', 'GTH']} | | | +- Li: q3 | +- Be: q4 (...)

Options are added as query string: /api/example?option1=value&option2=value . All routes are addressed by GET requests. On the elements option \u00a4 Every time the option elements can be used, you can use a list of comma separated atomic symbols, e.g., C,H,N,O , but also ranges, e.g., H,C-O , and Z numbers can be used instead of symbols, e,g., H,6-8 . Elements are limited to Z \u2264 103, i.e., hydrogen to Lawrencium. If you want to perform calculations outside this range, you probably have other problems on your plate than finding a basis set ;) Response format \u00a4 The response is in JSON, and always contains two main fields: { \"query\" : { \"type\" : \"TYPE\" , (...) }, \"result\" : { (...) } } query contains the request, to which result is the answer. In the following, fields will be detailed using the syntax for object attributes in JS, e.g., query.type . Routes \u00a4 /api/data \u00a4 Get, for basis sets and pseudopotentials, which elements are defined, and for each element, which basis set/pseudopotentials are defined. There is no option. Output: Field Type Description query.type string Always ALL result.basis_sets dictionary Contains three fields: build_date , which give the date at which the library was built, elements , which lists elements available for a given basis set, and tags , which lists the tags for each basis set. result.pseudopotentials dictionary Contains three fields: build_date , which give the date at which the library was built, elements , which lists elements available for a given pseudopotential, and tags , which lists the tags for each pseudopotential.

For computational reasons, while STO (slater-type orbitals, \\(\\propto e^{r}\\) ) should be used, GTO (gaussian type orbitals, \\(\\propto e^{r^2}\\) ) are preferred. In CP2K (as in other quantum chemistry programs), basis functions (i.e., atomic orbitals) are defined as: \\[\\psi_{i,\\ell m} (\\mathbf r) = R_{i,\\ell}(\\mathbf r)\\,Y_{\\ell m}(\\theta,\\phi),\\] where \\(R(r)\\) is the radial part, and \\(Y_{\\ell m}\\) is a spherical harmonic ( \\(\\ell\\) is the angular momentum and \\(m\\in[-\\ell,\\ell]\\) ) for the angular part. A weighted sum of primitives (Gaussian functions) is used for this part: \\[R_{i,\\ell}(r) = r^\\ell\\,\\sum_{j} c_{ij}\\,e^{-\\alpha_j\\,r^2},\\] where \\(\\alpha_{j}\\) is the exponent , while \\(c_{ij}\\) is the corresponding contraction coefficient . The two numbers defines the primitive \\(j\\) in the basis function \\(\\psi_i\\) . Thus, a basis sets is a library of contractions for each shell (s-type [ \\(\\ell=0\\) ], p-type [ \\(\\ell=1\\) ], d-type [ \\(\\ell=2\\) ], etc) of a given atom, containing the definition of the primitives (so a list of exponents and their corresponding contraction coefficients). Since the radial part is the same for each possible orbital in a shell (i.e., each possible value of \\(m\\) ), this is sufficient to define a basis set. But basis function can be grouped! Some basis functions (even with different \\(\\ell\\) ) may be grouped to share the same exponent. This is the case, e.g., in the (in)famous STO-3G (3 gaussians for each basis function) in which so-called \"SP\" basis functions are found, defined by using a common exponent but different contraction coefficient for each of the 3 gaussians defining the actual s-type and p-type basis function. MOLOPT basis sets (see below) are built on this principle. Multiple- \\(\\zeta\\) basis sets use \\(\\zeta\\) basis functions for each atomic orbitals in the atom. For example, double- \\(\\zeta\\) basis sets use two basis function for each atomic orbital (e.g., a total of 10 basis function for the carbon). They may be grouped to share the same exponent, or not. On top of that, two other kind of basis function might be added: polarization functions , which have a larger angular momentum than those of the ground state of the atom (e.g., d-type basis functions for the carbon), and diffuse functions , which have very small exponents (corresponding to very \"large\" Gaussian functions). Thus, the number of basis function for a given atom is very different from one basis set to the other. Note One way to ease the communication is to report, for each shell, the number of primitives (uncontracted set) in the form (uncontracted set) , and the number of basis functions (contracted set) in the form [contracted set] . For example, in a double-zeta basis set defined by 3 gaussian per basis function, the result for carbn would be (12s,6p) and [3s,2p] . The form [12s6p|3s2p] , combining the two is also found. However, for reasons that will become clear in the next section, CP2K does not only use all-electron basis sets. GTH pseudopotentials \u00a4 Info For the latest CP2K review, see 10.1063/5.0007045 (May 2020). The GPW method is described, e.g., here . Indeed, CP2K is able use an auxiliary plane wave (PW) basis set to perform its calculation with the GPW (and GAPW) method. To perform a such calculation, one needs to include all possible PW below a given threshold. In fact, increasing this threshold will monotonously improve the quality of the result (and the length of the calculation!). However, area where the electron density is rapidly changing requires PW with small wavelengths/high energy to be well described (i.e., large Fourier components), so high threshold, which would make the calculation impossible in practice. In practice, area where such changes are important are mostly located near the nuclei, \"thanks\" its ionic potential \\(V(r) = - \\frac{Z}{r}\\) . Hopefully, core and valence shell are generally well (spatially and energetically) separated, and core electrons are relatively unperturbed by the surrounding (chemically inert). So the idea behind pseudopotentials is to replace the effect of the nuclei and the core electrons (which are considered frozen ) by an effective potential (below a given threshold \\(r_c\\) ), and the valence electrons basis functions by ones with fewer nodes (since they do not need to be orthogonal to the, now removed, valence orbital), but with the same behavior outside the core region (for \\(r > r_c\\) ). Derivation of a pseudopotential Say one has a set of (orthogonal) core states \\(\\{|\\chi_n\\rangle\\}\\) (with their corresponding eigenvalue \\(\\{E_n\\}\\) ). The goal is to construct a pseudo-state \\(|\\phi\\rangle\\) for a valence state \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) (with its corresponding eigenvalue \\(E\\) ), in the form: \\[|\\psi\\rangle = |\\phi\\rangle + \\sum_n a_n |\\chi_n\\rangle.\\] Since the core and valence state must be orthogonal, \\(\\langle \\chi_m | \\psi \\rangle = 0 = \\langle \\chi_m | \\phi \\rangle + a_m\\) , so that \\[|\\psi\\rangle = |\\phi\\rangle - \\sum_n |\\chi_n\\rangle \\langle \\chi_n | \\phi\\rangle.\\] Substituting in Schr\u00f6dinger equation for \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) gives \\[\\hat H |\\phi\\rangle + \\sum_n (E-E_n) |\\chi_n\\rangle \\langle \\chi_n | \\phi\\rangle = E|\\phi\\rangle.\\] The pseudo-state thus obeys \\([\\hat H + \\hat V_{n\\ell}]\\, |\\phi\\rangle = E\\,|\\phi\\rangle\\) with: \\[\\hat V_{n\\ell} = \\sum_{n\\ell} (E-E_{n\\ell})\\,|\\chi_{n\\ell}\\rangle \\langle \\chi_{n\\ell} |.\\] where the energy of \\(|\\phi\\rangle\\) is the same as the one of \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) , thanks to the pseudopotential \\(\\hat V_{n\\ell}\\) . This extra potential depends on the quantum numbers \\(n\\) and \\(\\ell\\) due to its spherical symmetry. Furthermore, since \\(E > E_{n\\ell}\\) , it is a repulsive potenial. In practice, pseudopotential expressions are separated into a fully nonlocal form, thanks to the Kleinman-Bylander Transformation (see 10.1103/PhysRevLett.48.1425 ). Latter on, Goedecker, Teter and Hutter (GTH, see 10.1103/PhysRevB.54.1703 ) derived expressions those two parts which are suited for real and Fourier space integration and only requires a few adjustable parameters (in blue): \\[\\hat V_{PP} = \\hat V_{loc} + \\sum_{\\ell}^{\\textcolor{blue}{\\ell_{max}}} \\hat V_{nl,\\ell},\\] with \\[V_{loc}(r) = -\\frac{Z'}{r}\\,\\text{erf}\\left[\\frac{\\bar r}{\\sqrt 2}\\right] + \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\bar r^2}{2}\\right] \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\textcolor{blue}{C_i}\\,\\bar r^{2i-2}, \\text{ with } \\bar r = \\frac{r}{\\textcolor{blue}{r_c}},\\] and \\[V_{nl,\\ell} = \\sum_{ij}^{\\textcolor{blue}{N}} \\textcolor{blue}{h_{\\ell,ij}} \\,|p_{\\ell,i}\\rangle \\langle p_{\\ell,j}|, \\text{ with } p_{\\ell,i}(r) = N_{\\ell,i}(r)\\,\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\bar r^2}{2}\\right] \\text{ and } \\bar r = \\frac{r}{\\textcolor{blue}{r_{nl,\\ell}}}.\\] In the former, \\(Z'\\) is the ionic charge (i.e., the charge of the nucleus minus the one of the core electrons), while in the latter, \\(N_\\ell(r)\\) is a combination of spherical harmonic multiplied by a \\(\\ell\\) -dependent radial function. All the parameters in blue, together with the number of core electrons in each shell, define a GTH pseudopotential in CP2K (see, e.g., 10.1007/s00214-005-0655-y ). In particular, they are given as a local part plus a set of nonlinear projectors. Note It is totally possible, for a given atom, to have pseudopotentials with a different number of core electrons embeded in the potential: while a small number of core electrons ensure a good transferability (but lengthen the calculation), a large number results in a smoother potential. Pairing GTH pseudopotentials with basis sets \u00a4 Warning In practice, the number electron is dictated by the pseudopotential (which lists the number of valence electrons in each shell). CP2K will blindly use whatever basis set you give, since it has no way to check the information on the basis set side (not even the names, which are merely conventions). From the previous paragraph, it appears that one has to pair a given pseudopotential with a correctly defined basis set, that has been designed with the correct amount of core electron removed and that contains smoother (pseudo-) basis functions. Names of pseudopotentials and basis sets help to achieve this association: GTH pseudopotential are generally named GTH-<XFC> , where <XCF> is the name of a XC-functional. It is thus strongly suggested to use them together with the XCF in question. For a given atom, such potentials are nicknamed GTH-<XFC>-q<N> , where <N> is the number of valence electrons considered while building the potential. For example, a pseudopotential for carbon is nicknamed GTH-BLYP-q4 , indicate that this pseudopotential was designed with BLYP, and that was built using 4 valence electrons (so it embedded a total of 2 core electrons). Basis sets are generally named <XZ>-<NAME>-<XCF>-GTH or <XZ>-GTH-<XCF> (though this is definitely not an absolute rule!), where <XZ> describe the content of the basis set (e.g., DZV for double zeta, TZVP for triple zeta with extra polarization, etc), <NAME> is the name of the family (e.g., MOLOPT ) and <XCF> is the name of the XCF used to optimize the basis set. The <XCF> may not be present in the name: for example, TZVP-MOLOPT-GTH should work with all XCF, while TZVP-MOLOPT-PBE-GTH was specifically designed with PBE. The latter probably gives better results and should (probably) be preferred. Again, for each atom, a suffix -q<N> is added, indicated how much valence electrons were not considered while building this basis set. For example, for carbon, the nickname DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH-q4 indicates that this is a double-zeta basis set (plus polarization functions) of the MOLOPT family, designed to work with GTH pseudopotentials embedding 2 core electrons. Where are the basis sets and GTH pseudopotentials? When running a CP2K calculation, you have to provide two files, containing the basis set(s) and pseudopotential(s) used in your calculation: &DFT BASIS_SET_FILE_NAME BASIS_SET POTENTIAL_FILE_NAME GTH_POTENTIALS &END DFT Basis sets and pseudopotentials are scattered across different file in the CP2K data folder . However, the web interface of this project proposes an easier way to build your own taylor-made BASIS_SET and GTH_POTENTIALS files. This is equivalent, since the data are obtained from the same source and just presented with a shiny interface ;) If you are interested, the format of those two files is described here Working with all-electron basis sets \u00a4 Info The GAPW method is introduced, e.g., here or in 10.1007/s002140050523 . There also exists a special pseudopotential, ALL , which should be used for all-electron calculations. This is the pseudopotential of choice for GAPW calculations. It can be used with your usual all-electron basis sets (such as STO-3G, e.g., found in the BSE ). A curated list is available in the EMSL_BASIS_SETS file . Specially designed basis sets were also derived (found, e.g., in the ALL_BASIS_SETS file ), which contains ALL in their name or ends by -ae . The -q<N> number, if it exists (it is generally omitted), should be equal to the atomic number.","title":"On basis sets and GTH pseudopotentials in CP2K"},{"location":"users/basis_sets_and_pseudos/#on-basis-sets-and-gth-pseudopotentials-in-cp2k","text":"","title":"On basis sets and GTH pseudopotentials in CP2K"},{"location":"users/basis_sets_and_pseudos/#basis-sets","text":"Solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation generally resort to the use of the LCAO ( linear combination of atomic orbitals ) approximation. For computational reasons, while STO (slater-type orbitals, \\(\\propto e^{r}\\) ) should be used, GTO (gaussian type orbitals, \\(\\propto e^{r^2}\\) ) are preferred. In CP2K (as in other quantum chemistry programs), basis functions (i.e., atomic orbitals) are defined as: \\[\\psi_{i,\\ell m} (\\mathbf r) = R_{i,\\ell}(\\mathbf r)\\,Y_{\\ell m}(\\theta,\\phi),\\] where \\(R(r)\\) is the radial part, and \\(Y_{\\ell m}\\) is a spherical harmonic ( \\(\\ell\\) is the angular momentum and \\(m\\in[-\\ell,\\ell]\\) ) for the angular part. A weighted sum of primitives (Gaussian functions) is used for this part: \\[R_{i,\\ell}(r) = r^\\ell\\,\\sum_{j} c_{ij}\\,e^{-\\alpha_j\\,r^2},\\] where \\(\\alpha_{j}\\) is the exponent , while \\(c_{ij}\\) is the corresponding contraction coefficient . The two numbers defines the primitive \\(j\\) in the basis function \\(\\psi_i\\) . Thus, a basis sets is a library of contractions for each shell (s-type [ \\(\\ell=0\\) ], p-type [ \\(\\ell=1\\) ], d-type [ \\(\\ell=2\\) ], etc) of a given atom, containing the definition of the primitives (so a list of exponents and their corresponding contraction coefficients). Since the radial part is the same for each possible orbital in a shell (i.e., each possible value of \\(m\\) ), this is sufficient to define a basis set. But basis function can be grouped! Some basis functions (even with different \\(\\ell\\) ) may be grouped to share the same exponent. This is the case, e.g., in the (in)famous STO-3G (3 gaussians for each basis function) in which so-called \"SP\" basis functions are found, defined by using a common exponent but different contraction coefficient for each of the 3 gaussians defining the actual s-type and p-type basis function. MOLOPT basis sets (see below) are built on this principle. Multiple- \\(\\zeta\\) basis sets use \\(\\zeta\\) basis functions for each atomic orbitals in the atom. For example, double- \\(\\zeta\\) basis sets use two basis function for each atomic orbital (e.g., a total of 10 basis function for the carbon). They may be grouped to share the same exponent, or not. On top of that, two other kind of basis function might be added: polarization functions , which have a larger angular momentum than those of the ground state of the atom (e.g., d-type basis functions for the carbon), and diffuse functions , which have very small exponents (corresponding to very \"large\" Gaussian functions). Thus, the number of basis function for a given atom is very different from one basis set to the other. Note One way to ease the communication is to report, for each shell, the number of primitives (uncontracted set) in the form (uncontracted set) , and the number of basis functions (contracted set) in the form [contracted set] . For example, in a double-zeta basis set defined by 3 gaussian per basis function, the result for carbn would be (12s,6p) and [3s,2p] . The form [12s6p|3s2p] , combining the two is also found. However, for reasons that will become clear in the next section, CP2K does not only use all-electron basis sets.","title":"Basis sets"},{"location":"users/basis_sets_and_pseudos/#gth-pseudopotentials","text":"Info For the latest CP2K review, see 10.1063/5.0007045 (May 2020). The GPW method is described, e.g., here . Indeed, CP2K is able use an auxiliary plane wave (PW) basis set to perform its calculation with the GPW (and GAPW) method. To perform a such calculation, one needs to include all possible PW below a given threshold. In fact, increasing this threshold will monotonously improve the quality of the result (and the length of the calculation!). However, area where the electron density is rapidly changing requires PW with small wavelengths/high energy to be well described (i.e., large Fourier components), so high threshold, which would make the calculation impossible in practice. In practice, area where such changes are important are mostly located near the nuclei, \"thanks\" its ionic potential \\(V(r) = - \\frac{Z}{r}\\) . Hopefully, core and valence shell are generally well (spatially and energetically) separated, and core electrons are relatively unperturbed by the surrounding (chemically inert). So the idea behind pseudopotentials is to replace the effect of the nuclei and the core electrons (which are considered frozen ) by an effective potential (below a given threshold \\(r_c\\) ), and the valence electrons basis functions by ones with fewer nodes (since they do not need to be orthogonal to the, now removed, valence orbital), but with the same behavior outside the core region (for \\(r > r_c\\) ). Derivation of a pseudopotential Say one has a set of (orthogonal) core states \\(\\{|\\chi_n\\rangle\\}\\) (with their corresponding eigenvalue \\(\\{E_n\\}\\) ). The goal is to construct a pseudo-state \\(|\\phi\\rangle\\) for a valence state \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) (with its corresponding eigenvalue \\(E\\) ), in the form: \\[|\\psi\\rangle = |\\phi\\rangle + \\sum_n a_n |\\chi_n\\rangle.\\] Since the core and valence state must be orthogonal, \\(\\langle \\chi_m | \\psi \\rangle = 0 = \\langle \\chi_m | \\phi \\rangle + a_m\\) , so that \\[|\\psi\\rangle = |\\phi\\rangle - \\sum_n |\\chi_n\\rangle \\langle \\chi_n | \\phi\\rangle.\\] Substituting in Schr\u00f6dinger equation for \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) gives \\[\\hat H |\\phi\\rangle + \\sum_n (E-E_n) |\\chi_n\\rangle \\langle \\chi_n | \\phi\\rangle = E|\\phi\\rangle.\\] The pseudo-state thus obeys \\([\\hat H + \\hat V_{n\\ell}]\\, |\\phi\\rangle = E\\,|\\phi\\rangle\\) with: \\[\\hat V_{n\\ell} = \\sum_{n\\ell} (E-E_{n\\ell})\\,|\\chi_{n\\ell}\\rangle \\langle \\chi_{n\\ell} |.\\] where the energy of \\(|\\phi\\rangle\\) is the same as the one of \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) , thanks to the pseudopotential \\(\\hat V_{n\\ell}\\) . This extra potential depends on the quantum numbers \\(n\\) and \\(\\ell\\) due to its spherical symmetry. Furthermore, since \\(E > E_{n\\ell}\\) , it is a repulsive potenial. In practice, pseudopotential expressions are separated into a fully nonlocal form, thanks to the Kleinman-Bylander Transformation (see 10.1103/PhysRevLett.48.1425 ). Latter on, Goedecker, Teter and Hutter (GTH, see 10.1103/PhysRevB.54.1703 ) derived expressions those two parts which are suited for real and Fourier space integration and only requires a few adjustable parameters (in blue): \\[\\hat V_{PP} = \\hat V_{loc} + \\sum_{\\ell}^{\\textcolor{blue}{\\ell_{max}}} \\hat V_{nl,\\ell},\\] with \\[V_{loc}(r) = -\\frac{Z'}{r}\\,\\text{erf}\\left[\\frac{\\bar r}{\\sqrt 2}\\right] + \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\bar r^2}{2}\\right] \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\textcolor{blue}{C_i}\\,\\bar r^{2i-2}, \\text{ with } \\bar r = \\frac{r}{\\textcolor{blue}{r_c}},\\] and \\[V_{nl,\\ell} = \\sum_{ij}^{\\textcolor{blue}{N}} \\textcolor{blue}{h_{\\ell,ij}} \\,|p_{\\ell,i}\\rangle \\langle p_{\\ell,j}|, \\text{ with } p_{\\ell,i}(r) = N_{\\ell,i}(r)\\,\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\bar r^2}{2}\\right] \\text{ and } \\bar r = \\frac{r}{\\textcolor{blue}{r_{nl,\\ell}}}.\\] In the former, \\(Z'\\) is the ionic charge (i.e., the charge of the nucleus minus the one of the core electrons), while in the latter, \\(N_\\ell(r)\\) is a combination of spherical harmonic multiplied by a \\(\\ell\\) -dependent radial function. All the parameters in blue, together with the number of core electrons in each shell, define a GTH pseudopotential in CP2K (see, e.g., 10.1007/s00214-005-0655-y ). In particular, they are given as a local part plus a set of nonlinear projectors. Note It is totally possible, for a given atom, to have pseudopotentials with a different number of core electrons embeded in the potential: while a small number of core electrons ensure a good transferability (but lengthen the calculation), a large number results in a smoother potential.","title":"GTH pseudopotentials"},{"location":"users/basis_sets_and_pseudos/#pairing-gth-pseudopotentials-with-basis-sets","text":"Warning In practice, the number electron is dictated by the pseudopotential (which lists the number of valence electrons in each shell). CP2K will blindly use whatever basis set you give, since it has no way to check the information on the basis set side (not even the names, which are merely conventions). From the previous paragraph, it appears that one has to pair a given pseudopotential with a correctly defined basis set, that has been designed with the correct amount of core electron removed and that contains smoother (pseudo-) basis functions. Names of pseudopotentials and basis sets help to achieve this association: GTH pseudopotential are generally named GTH-<XFC> , where <XCF> is the name of a XC-functional. It is thus strongly suggested to use them together with the XCF in question. For a given atom, such potentials are nicknamed GTH-<XFC>-q<N> , where <N> is the number of valence electrons considered while building the potential. For example, a pseudopotential for carbon is nicknamed GTH-BLYP-q4 , indicate that this pseudopotential was designed with BLYP, and that was built using 4 valence electrons (so it embedded a total of 2 core electrons). Basis sets are generally named <XZ>-<NAME>-<XCF>-GTH or <XZ>-GTH-<XCF> (though this is definitely not an absolute rule!), where <XZ> describe the content of the basis set (e.g., DZV for double zeta, TZVP for triple zeta with extra polarization, etc), <NAME> is the name of the family (e.g., MOLOPT ) and <XCF> is the name of the XCF used to optimize the basis set. The <XCF> may not be present in the name: for example, TZVP-MOLOPT-GTH should work with all XCF, while TZVP-MOLOPT-PBE-GTH was specifically designed with PBE. The latter probably gives better results and should (probably) be preferred. Again, for each atom, a suffix -q<N> is added, indicated how much valence electrons were not considered while building this basis set. For example, for carbon, the nickname DZVP-MOLOPT-GTH-q4 indicates that this is a double-zeta basis set (plus polarization functions) of the MOLOPT family, designed to work with GTH pseudopotentials embedding 2 core electrons.
