# This file contains a list of data sources
# (which is a given location in a website containing different files).
#
# Each data source has the following attributes:
#
# - base: base URL, might content placeholders of the form `{name}`
# - data: dictionary of values for each placeholder.
# - files: list of files to fetch. Each file has the following attributes:
#
#   + name: name of the file,
#   + type: give the type of data found in the file, can be either `BASIS_SETS` or `PSEUDOPOTENTIALS`,
#   + references: list of references, in the form of DOI,
#   + rules: set of rule to modify or discard names,
#     as a dictionary where the key is a REGEX matching a name,
#     and the value is its replacement (empty values means that the name is discarded).
#
#   The full URL to download the file will be given by `base.replace(**data) + name`.
